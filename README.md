# DSA

Contains code examples and problem solutions I wrote while studying data structures
and algorithms. Most of the problems are from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), and
specifically from [SeanPrashad](https://github.com/SeanPrashad/)'s list,
available on [the website](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/) and
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/SeanPrashad/leetcode-patterns).

I've divided the problem set into various *parts*, with each *part* containing problems
from roughly related areas.

Solution files are named as `A_B_C_D.cpp`, where-
- `A` is the difficulty of the problem, with `1` for "Easy", `2` for "Medium" and `3` for
"Hard". This is `0` for generic algorithms which were written just for reference and aren't
related to any problem in particular.
- `B` is the serial number of the problem, according to the order in which I solved the
problems.
- `C` is the name of the problem, as it appears in the URL of the problem page on LeetCode.
For generic algorithms, this is the name of the algorithm.
- `D` (optional) is the method used by the solution.


The solutions are LeetCode submissions which pass all test cases. There's no driver code
included, and hence these cannot be compiled as-is.
