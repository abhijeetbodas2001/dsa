# DSA

Contains code examples and problem solutions I wrote while studying data structures
and algorithms. Most of the problems are from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), and
specifically from [SeanPrashad](https://github.com/SeanPrashad/)'s list,
available on [the website](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/) and
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/SeanPrashad/leetcode-patterns).

The solutions are LeetCode submissions which pass all test cases. There's no driver code
included, and hence these cannot be compiled as-is.

All code here is distributed under the [GNU GPLv3](./LICENSE).
